# NepaliNewsPdfGenerator

**Motivation**

1. The way newspapwers allow us to read news is *defective by design*. Some allow single page PDF, some allow jpg images.
Why not allow a whole PDF?
2. A central repository for all NewsPapers.

**What the library does**

Downloads single pages of images from various sources and combines them to single PDF file.

**Which sources are supported**

1. Kathmandu Post
2. Kantipur
3. Republica
4. Nagarik News
5. The Himalayan Times

**Where can I see the PDF**

The PDFs are generated daily at http://maya.bibek.com.np/newspapers/files/

**How to reach the code author?**
